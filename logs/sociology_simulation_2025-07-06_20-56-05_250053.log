Here are my world creation decisions for the 石器时代 (Stone Age) simulation:

TERRAIN TYPES:
1. TERRAIN RIVERBANK 'Fertile land near water sources' cost=1.1 resources={{clay: 0.7, fish: 0.6, flint: 0.3}} color=teal
2. TERRAIN FOREST 'Dense woodlands with mixed vegetation' cost=1.4 resources={{wood: 0.9, berries: 0.5, game: 0.4}} color=dark_green
3. TERRAIN PLAINS 'Open grasslands with scattered trees' cost=1.0 resources={{game: 0.6, wild_grains: 0.4, flint: 0.2}} color=yellow_green
4. TERRAIN MOUNTAIN 'Rocky elevated areas with caves' cost=1.8 resources={{flint: 0.8, stone: 0.9, copper_ore: 0.1}} color=grey
5. TERRAIN SWAMP 'Wetlands with abundant reeds' cost=1.6 resources={{reeds: 0.7, fish: 0.4, clay: 0.5}} color=dark_teal

RESOURCE DISTRIBUTIONS:
1. RESOURCE flint distribution={{RIVERBANK: 0.3, MOUNTAIN: 0.8, PLAINS: 0.2}} depletion=0.15 regen=0.02
2. RESOURCE wood distribution={{FOREST: 0.9, PLAINS: 0.3}} depletion=0.1 regen=0.07
3. RESOURCE game distribution={{FOREST: 0.4, PLAINS: 0.6, SWAMP: 0.2}} depletion=0.2 regen=0.15
4. RESOURCE clay distribution={{RIVERBANK: 0.7, SWAMP: 0.5}} depletion=0.05 regen=0.1
5. RESOURCE fish distribution={{RIVERBANK: 0.6, SWAMP: 0.4}} depletion=0.25 regen=0.2
6. RESOURCE berries distribution={{FOREST: 0.5, PLAINS: 0.2}} depletion=0.3 regen=0.25

WORLD RULES:
1. RULE seasonal_migration 'Animal herds migrate seasonally' conditions=['turn_mod_50=0'] effects=['redistribute_game_resources'] priority=1
2. RULE tool_breakage 'Primitive tools break frequently' conditions=['action_harvest'] effects=['random_tool_loss:0.1'] priority=2
3. RULE population_pressure 'Tribes expand when resources are abundant' conditions=['resource_abundance>0.8'] effects=['population_growth:0.05'] priority=3

These elements reflect the Stone Age environment where:
- Survival depends on basic natural resources
- Movement is constrained by primitive technology
- Resources are tied closely to specific terrain types
- Seasonal patterns significantly impact availability
- Population dynamics are directly tied to resource availability
- Technology is limited to stone tools and basic materials
