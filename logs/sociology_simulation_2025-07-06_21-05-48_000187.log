Here are my world creation decisions for the 石器时代 simulation:

TERRAIN TYPES:
1. TERRAIN RIVER_VALLEY 'Fertile land near freshwater sources' cost=1.0 resources={{clay: 0.7, fish: 0.6, reeds: 0.5}} color=teal
2. TERRAIN FOREST 'Dense woodlands with mixed vegetation' cost=1.4 resources={{wood: 0.9, berries: 0.4, game: 0.3}} color=dark_green
3. TERRAIN GRASSLAND 'Open plains with scattered vegetation' cost=1.0 resources={{game: 0.5, berries: 0.3, flint: 0.2}} color=yellow_green
4. TERRAIN MOUNTAIN 'Rocky highland areas with caves' cost=1.8 resources={{flint: 0.8, stone: 0.7, copper_ore: 0.1}} color=gray
5. TERRAIN SWAMP 'Wetlands with poor drainage' cost=1.6 resources={{reeds: 0.6, clay: 0.4, medicinal_plants: 0.2}} color=dark_teal

RESOURCE DISTRIBUTIONS:
1. RESOURCE flint distribution={{MOUNTAIN: 0.8, GRASSLAND: 0.2}} depletion=0.05 regen=0.02
2. RESOURCE wood distribution={{FOREST: 0.9, RIVER_VALLEY: 0.3}} depletion=0.1 regen=0.07
3. RESOURCE game distribution={{FOREST: 0.3, GRASSLAND: 0.5}} depletion=0.15 regen=0.1
4. RESOURCE clay distribution={{RIVER_VALLEY: 0.7, SWAMP: 0.4}} depletion=0.08 regen=0.05
5. RESOURCE fish distribution={{RIVER_VALLEY: 0.6}} depletion=0.12 regen=0.15
6. RESOURCE berries distribution={{FOREST: 0.4, GRASSLAND: 0.3}} depletion=0.2 regen=0.25

WORLD RULES:
1. RULE seasonal_migration 'Animal herds migrate with seasons' conditions=['turn_mod_12=6'] effects=['game_distribution_shift'] priority=1
2. RULE tool_innovation 'Chance for new tool discovery' conditions=['population>50', 'flint_abundance>0.7'] effects=['tech_progress'] priority=2
3. RULE river_flooding 'Periodic flooding renews river valleys' conditions=['turn_mod_24=0'] effects=['clay_replenish', 'fish_boost'] priority=1

These elements reflect:
- Hunter-gatherer lifestyle with stone tool technology
- Dependence on natural resources and seasonal patterns
- Early human settlement patterns near water sources
- Limited resource processing capabilities
- Environmental factors shaping early human development

2025-07-06 21:07:16.401 | INFO     | sociology_simulation.world:step:779 - 1. **Fragmented Social Dynamics with Isolated Goal Pursuit**
2025-07-06 21:07:16.402 | INFO     | sociology_simulation.world:step:779 - The complete lack of social connections (0.0 per agent) and groups suggests agents are acting as lone individuals rather than a cohesive tribe. This is reinforced by their recent activities: one agent seeks medicinal herbs, another focuses on hunter training, and a third fails to collect resources—all with no evidence of coordination. The 70% population decline (from 10 to 3) may be a consequence of this lack of cooperation, as isolated survival is unsustainable in harsh conditions.

The lone survivor (age 69, critically low health) is likely the last elder—yet their recent activity ("train the strongest young hunters") suggests delusion or ritualized behavior, as there are no hunters left to train. This hints at a breakdown where cultural memory persists despite societal collapse.

2025-07-06 21:08:24.700 | INFO     | sociology_simulation.world:step:779 - 1. **Collapse of Social Structure**: With only 1 agent remaining (from an initial 10) and zero social connections, groups, or skills, this tribe has effectively lost all cooperative capacity. The lone survivor's advanced age (70) and critically low health (1%) suggest a breakdown in intergenerational knowledge transfer—there are no "young hunters" to train, despite the agent's stated goal. This is a terminal state for collective survival.
2025-07-06 21:08:24.700 | INFO     | sociology_simulation.world:step:779 - 2. **Resource Scarcity Overrides Mobility**: Despite moving east (likely searching for resources or training grounds), the agent's hunger (28%) remains unresolved, and health is catastrophically low. This implies either the environment is too barren or the agent lacks the physical capacity (due to age/health) to exploit resources. Movement isn't translating into survival gains—a sign of failed adaptation.
