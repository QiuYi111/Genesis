2025-07-06 00:09:16.662 | INFO     | sociology_simulation.world:resolve:251 - Flint(1) (age 56) attempting action: Given my goal to discover edible plants and medicinal herbs, and noticing berries at position [26,36] (GRASSLAND with FLINT and BERRIES), I will move north to collect and study these berries for potential food or medicinal value. 

Action: "move north to collect and examine berries at position [26,36]"
2025-07-06 00:09:16.758 | INFO     | sociology_simulation.world:resolve:251 - Flint(4) (age 21) attempting action: move north to the river at [28,57] to catch more fish and demonstrate my hunting prowess.
2025-07-06 00:09:16.956 | INFO     | sociology_simulation.world:resolve:251 - Ember(9) (age 48) attempting action: Given my high charm attribute and goal to become a respected storyteller, I'll move to the nearby riverbank (position [52,56] to [55,56]) to collect clay that can be used to craft storytelling tokens or trade items to build social connections. 

"Move east towards the river to collect clay for crafting storytelling aids."
2025-07-06 00:09:16.972 | INFO     | sociology_simulation.world:resolve:251 - Flare(3) (age 19) attempting action: Given my goal to become a respected storyteller and peacemaker, and noticing Agent Storm (an older, charming individual) nearby at the river, I will: 

"Move to position [8,48] to chat with Storm about tribal stories and wisdom." 

This leverages my high charm attribute to build social connections with an elder who likely has valuable knowledge to share.
2025-07-06 00:09:17.099 | INFO     | sociology_simulation.world:resolve:251 - Ember(0) (age 60) attempting action: Given my goal to become a respected elder and my high charm attribute, I should focus on building social connections first. Since there are no other agents visible currently, I'll move towards the river at [27,24] to collect fish - a valuable resource that can be used to establish goodwill through sharing later. 

Action: "move east to [27,24] to collect fish for future social exchanges"
2025-07-06 00:09:17.201 | INFO     | sociology_simulation.world:resolve:251 - Ember(2) (age 48) attempting action: Given my high charm attribute and goal to become a storyteller and peacemaker, I should start by gathering resources that could help me trade for stories or create storytelling tools. I see flint and berries nearby at position [63,23], which could be useful for crafting or trading.

Action: "Collect flint and berries at position [63,23] to gather materials for future storytelling tools or trade."
2025-07-06 00:09:17.974 | INFO     | sociology_simulation.world:resolve:251 - Storm(7) (age 27) attempting action: Given my goal to become a skilled toolmaker and the presence of flint resources nearby, I will move to position (26,32) to collect flint for crafting tools. 

"move north to collect flint at position (26,32)"
2025-07-06 00:09:18.562 | INFO     | sociology_simulation.world:resolve:251 - Storm(5) (age 67) attempting action: Given my goal to become a respected elder through storytelling and mediation, and noticing the young agent Flare nearby (who has high charm but low strength and curiosity), I should initiate a social interaction to share wisdom and build my reputation.

"Chat with Agent Flare about river fishing techniques and the importance of patience in life." 

This leverages:
1. My position by the river (natural teaching environment)
2. Flare's likely need for guidance (low strength/curiosity)
3. My high charm for effective communication
4. Building "wise" reputation through practical wisdom sharing
2025-07-06 00:09:19.322 | INFO     | sociology_simulation.world:resolve:251 - Flint(6) (age 68) attempting action: As an elder seeking to build respect through wisdom and leadership, I will move to the nearby river at [51,4] to collect clay, which can be used to create pottery for storytelling symbols and practical tribe use. This demonstrates both practical skills and cultural knowledge to share with younger generations. 

Action: "move east to [51,4] to collect clay"
2025-07-06 00:09:20.459 | INFO     | sociology_simulation.world:resolve:251 - Flint(8) (age 28) attempting action: Given my goal to become the tribe's chief explorer by discovering new hunting grounds and edible plant sources, and noticing that Agent Storm (aid 7) is nearby at [26,35] with high curiosity and charm attributes similar to mine, I should:

"chat with Agent Storm about forming an exploration team to discover new hunting grounds together" 

This action aligns with my goal by potentially increasing my social connections and leadership score while pooling resources/knowledge for exploration. Storm's high curiosity makes them a good candidate for joint exploration.
