Here are my world creation decisions for the Áü≥Âô®Êó∂‰ª£ simulation:

TERRAIN TYPES:
1. TERRAIN PLAINS 'Open grasslands with scattered bushes' cost=1.0 resources={{berries: 0.6, flint: 0.2}} color=yellow_green
2. TERRAIN FOREST 'Dense woodlands with ancient trees' cost=1.4 resources={{wood: 0.9, mushrooms: 0.4, game: 0.3}} color=dark_green
3. TERRAIN RIVERBANK 'Fertile land along water sources' cost=1.2 resources={{fish: 0.7, clay: 0.5, reeds: 0.4}} color=light_blue
4. TERRAIN MOUNTAIN 'Rocky elevated terrain' cost=2.0 resources={{stone: 0.8, flint: 0.5}} color=grey
5. TERRAIN SWAMP 'Wet marshy areas' cost=1.6 resources={{reeds: 0.7, medicinal_plants: 0.3}} color=dark_blue

RESOURCE DISTRIBUTIONS:
1. RESOURCE wood distribution={{FOREST: 0.9, PLAINS: 0.1}} depletion=0.15 regen=0.07
2. RESOURCE stone distribution={{MOUNTAIN: 0.8, RIVERBANK: 0.2}} depletion=0.1 regen=0.03
3. RESOURCE fish distribution={{RIVERBANK: 0.7}} depletion=0.2 regen=0.1
4. RESOURCE game distribution={{FOREST: 0.3, PLAINS: 0.4}} depletion=0.25 regen=0.08
5. RESOURCE flint distribution={{MOUNTAIN: 0.5, PLAINS: 0.2}} depletion=0.05 regen=0.01
6. RESOURCE berries distribution={{PLAINS: 0.6, FOREST: 0.3}} depletion=0.3 regen=0.15

WORLD RULES:
1. RULE seasonal_migration 'Animals migrate with seasons' conditions=['turn_mod_100'] effects=['game_distribution_change'] priority=1
2. RULE tool_breakage 'Primitive tools degrade over time' conditions=['tool_use'] effects=['tool_depletion'] priority=2
3. RULE tribal_expansion 'Successful tribes grow in size' conditions=['resource_surplus'] effects=['population_growth'] priority=3

These elements reflect the primitive technology, hunter-gatherer lifestyle, and environmental dependencies of the Áü≥Âô®Êó∂‰ª£. The terrain types provide diverse but challenging environments, while the resources focus on essential survival needs and primitive tool-making materials. The rules introduce dynamic challenges that early human societies would have faced.
